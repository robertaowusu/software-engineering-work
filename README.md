 Case Diagram for E-commerce System with eCRM
Project Overview
The E-commerce System with eCRM Use Case Diagram provides a visual representation of the functional requirements of an e-commerce platform integrated with an electronic Customer Relationship Management (eCRM) system. This system aims to streamline customer interactions, facilitate seamless product purchases, and improve organizational operations by leveraging eCRM capabilities.

The diagram highlights interactions between users (actors) and the system, detailing the various functionalities that support different stakeholders, including Customers, Staff, and Administrators (Admin).

Diagram Explanation
1. Actors and Their Roles
The system identifies three distinct types of users (Actors), each with specific roles and responsibilities:

Customer:

Represents the end-users who interact with the system to browse products, place orders, and provide feedback.
Typical use cases include searching products, purchasing, and tracking deliveries.
Staff:

Represents employees who manage product inventory and customer communication.
Use cases for staff include adding new products, responding to customer feedback, and interacting with customers via chat.
Admin:

Represents the system administrator responsible for managing staff and generating operational reports.
Admin use cases include adding new staff members and viewing system reports.
2. Use Case Descriptions
Customer Use Cases
Register Online: Customers can create an account to access system features.
Search Product: Customers can browse or search for desired products.
Place Order: Enables customers to make purchases and process payments.
Post Feedback: Customers can provide feedback on products or services.
Chat Online: Provides real-time communication between customers and staff for assistance.
Track Delivery: Customers can monitor the status of their orders in transit.
Staff Use Cases
Add New Products: Staff can upload new products to the system.
Reply Feedback: Staff can respond to customer feedback to resolve issues or provide assistance.
Respond to Chat: Enables real-time chat interaction with customers to answer queries.
Admin Use Cases
Add New Staff: The admin can register new staff members to the system.
View Report: Admins can generate, review, and analyze reports related to system operations.
3. Relationships Between Actors and Use Cases
Customer:

Interacts with the system to perform user-level operations related to product discovery, order management, and communication.
Represents the primary external actor driving the system's primary functionality.
Staff:

Interfaces with the system to support customer needs and ensure smooth operation of the product inventory and feedback system.
Admin:

Maintains oversight over the system by managing staff and generating reports for decision-making and performance evaluation.
Purpose and Benefits of the Diagram
Purpose:
Requirement Visualization:

The diagram captures all functional requirements of the system at a high level, enabling developers and stakeholders to understand the expected behavior of the system.
Role Clarification:

Clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of each actor, ensuring proper alignment of functionalities with user needs.
System Design:

Provides a foundation for software design by identifying key use cases and their relationships with actors.
Benefits:
Improved Customer Experience: Customers can easily search for products, place orders, and receive assistance in real-time.

Enhanced Operational Efficiency: Staff can efficiently manage inventory and customer communication.

Streamlined Administration: Admins can oversee staff and generate actionable insights through reports.

Key Observations for Evaluation
Comprehensive Actor-Use Case Relationships: Each actor is mapped to their respective system functionalities, ensuring clarity and coverage of requirements.

Modular Approach: The separation of use cases by actor roles reflects a modular design, simplifying implementation and scalability.

Scalability: The system can be extended with additional functionalities or actors without significant changes to the existing structure.

Conclusion
This Use Case Diagram provides a structured approach to understanding the interactions between users and the system. It serves as a vital tool for the software engineering lifecycle, facilitating requirements analysis, system design, and testing phases.

This document ensures a holistic view of the system functionalities and prepares developers to deliver a robust and user-friendly solution.
